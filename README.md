# stormender-poster
A small project as my entry to the Web Dev &amp; Design discord server webjam

The challenge is to make a web poster for a movie (real or fictional), and use exactly one web page, without adding or removing content, unless you already made space for them.

Closing and other thoughts: 
One thing I want to definitely improve about the project is add a KDA soundtrack over the rain effect, but that's most definitely an IP violation. 
Other than that, I think the constraints on the project held me back a little bit, but not too much. Managing images horizontally is rather frustrating. Other than that I am relatively happy with how the project turned out, there is a lot of room for improvement of course (and it only exposes my present mediocrity as a designer), but I am content with what I managed to produce, and I will do better next time. Some of the code on the page can definitely be optimized (remind me to never chain setTimeout in actual production code), but for the small purposes of a webjam, I decided it was unnecesary. Overall, I will definitely win the next one!
